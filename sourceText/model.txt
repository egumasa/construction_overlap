Jack is a businessman. Three weeks ago, he arrived at an airport with a big basket. It was too heavy to carry, so he put it down. Two people were watching him from behind. One was a short boy with a striped shirt. The other was a tall man, and he wore sunglasses.
The short boy came close to Jack. When they started to talk, the tall man picked up the big basket.
When Jack realized that the two people were thieves and stole his basket, they ran away from the airport.
Jack hurried to a police officer and asked for help. The police officer tried to stop the thieves. He couldnâ€™t stop them. The thieves got into a car and drove off.
The car passed a zoo and went into the woods.
When it reached the woods, it stopped, and the two people got out. They opened the basket that they had stolen and suddenly a snake appeared!
